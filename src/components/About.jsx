        Hi, my name is Arti. I’m a creative Frontend Developer with a strong
        passion for building engaging and user-friendly web applications. <br />My
        portfolio showcases a collection of projects that reflect my skills in
        responsive design, modern JavaScript frameworks like React, and a focus
        on clean, intuitive user interfaces. <br /> Each project demonstrates my
        ability to bring ideas to life — from concept to deployment — with
        attention to detail and a strong emphasis on performance and user
